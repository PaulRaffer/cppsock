# cppsock
a (mostly) platform independent low-level implementation for sockets

## building
1. clone this repository
2. run ``make lib`` to build the library, the output library will be placed in the ``out`` directory
Note: If you want to build for windows, run the ``build_win.bat`` file instead of ``make lib`` since the batch file is the currently the best way to build for windows. The output library is still put into the ``out`` directory.
